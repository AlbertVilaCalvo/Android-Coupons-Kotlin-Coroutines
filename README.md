# Coupons Android app

This is a simple Android app that I did for a job interview process.

The app is build with entirely with Kotlin. It uses [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) for asynchronous work, [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) for Dependency Injection and [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) for loading images.

There are unit tests for one Presenter and one Use Case.
